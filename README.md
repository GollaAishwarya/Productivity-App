# Productivity-App

This project is a web-based productivity platform designed to help users stay organized, track their tasks, and maintain motivation throughout their day. It is built using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, while the backend is powered by Express.js with SQLite as the database for efficient and lightweight data storage. The website provides features such as task management, where users can add, update, and delete tasks, and a leaderboard that allows users to track their performance and compare progress with peers. It also includes a daily productivity tracker to monitor goals and achievements, while an upcoming feature for email notifications will remind users of their pending tasks.

From a technical perspective, the project follows a modular structure with separate directories for the frontend, backend, and database. The frontend is implemented with React components to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience, while the backend uses RESTful APIs developed in Express.js to handle requests and interact with the SQLite database. This combination of technologies makes the application lightweight, efficient, and easy to deploy.
